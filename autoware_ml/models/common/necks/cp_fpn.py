"""Lightweight FPN for the StreamPETR image neck.

Plain 1x1 lateral convolutions (no norm, no activation), a nearest-neighbor
top-down pathway, and a single 3x3 output convolution on the highest-resolution
level only. This is the neck the StreamPETR recipe is tuned for;
:class:`GeneralizedLSSFPN` adds concat + BN + ReLU and behaves differently.
